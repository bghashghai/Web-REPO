    <h2> More About Me </h2>
      <p>I am a junior studying Strategic Communication (public relations track) and minoring in Creative Technology and Design. I am originally from the Bay Area, about 45 minutes south of San Francisco. I have taken one coding class before, computational reasoning, which focused on different coding languages. I am excited to focus more on design and development in this course. On campus I am the Director of Membership for PRSSA, the Public Relations Student Society of America, and a peer mentor for Stampede for Success.</p>
